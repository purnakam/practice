## Introduction

This repository serves as a playground for practicing Python programming. Whether you're exploring new concepts, refining your skills, or simply having fun coding, you're encouraged to contribute your practice projects here.

## Projects

### To-Do List

The to-do list project is a simple application that allows users to manage their tasks. It's a great starting point for practicing basic Python concepts such as data structures, file handling, and user input. Below are the setup instructions for the to-do list project:

#### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `to_do_list` directory.
3. Run the `to_do_list.py` script to start the application.

#### Features

- Add tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Remove tasks from the list.
- Save tasks to a file for future reference.
- Load previously saved tasks.

Feel free to enhance the to-do list project by adding new features or improving existing ones. The possibilities are endless!

### Number Guessing Game

The number guessing game is a classic Python project where the program generates a random number and the player has to guess it. It's a fun way to practice conditional statements, loops, and user input. Here's how to get started with the number guessing game:

#### Setup

1. Navigate to the `number_guessing_game` directory.
2. Run the `number_guessing_game.py` script to play the game.

#### Rules

- The program will generate a random number between a specified range.
- The player needs to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.
- After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### Snake Water Gun Game (Method 1)

The Snake Water Gun game, also known as Rock Paper Scissors, is a popular hand game often played between two people. In this version, the player competes against the computer. It's a great exercise for practicing conditional statements and random number generation. Here's how to play the game:

#### Setup

1. Navigate to the `snake_water_gun_game_method1` directory.
2. Run the `snake_water_gun_game.py` script to start the game.

#### Rules

- The player chooses between Snake, Water, or Gun.
- The computer randomly selects one of the options.
- The winner is determined based on the following rules:
  - Snake drinks Water, so Snake wins.
  - Gun shoots Snake, so Gun wins.
  - Water floats on Gun, so Gun wins.
  - In case of a tie, the game is a draw.

### Snake Water Gun Game (Method 2)

Another implementation of the Snake Water Gun game, this version offers a different approach to coding the game logic. It's an opportunity to explore alternative programming techniques and design patterns. Here's how to try out this version:

#### Setup

1. Navigate to the `snake_water_gun_game_method2` directory.
2. Run the `snake_water_gun_game.py` script to start the game.

#### Rules

- The rules of the game remain the same as described in Method 1.

Feel free to experiment with both versions of the Snake Water Gun game and compare the approaches used!
